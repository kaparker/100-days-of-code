# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Motivation

I've been wanting to sign up to 100 days of code for a while. I've recently been trying to create a few web apps and started the FreeCodeCamp course so I can improve my skills in design and layout (rather than using bootstrap...). Decided to finally commit to the 100 days and start recording my progress here!

### Day 1: June 17th, 2019

**Goals for first 30 days**
1. Create personal webpage
2. CodeWars 3 times per week to improve python

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Completed CSS Flexbox and working through CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to getting started on some examples, finding the CSS tutorials quite repetitive. Have learnt a lot of CSS during the challenges though, will be useful when applying to the projects!
