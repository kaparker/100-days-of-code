# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Motivation

I've been wanting to sign up to 100 days of code for a while. I've recently been trying to create a few web apps and started the FreeCodeCamp course so I can improve my skills in design and layout (rather than using bootstrap...). Decided to finally commit to the 100 days and start recording my progress here!

### Day 1: June 17th, 2019

**Goals for first 30 days**
1. Create personal webpage
2. CodeWars 3 times per week to improve python

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Completed CSS Flexbox and working through CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to getting started on some examples, finding the CSS tutorials quite repetitive. Have learnt a lot of CSS during the challenges though, will be useful when applying to the projects!

2. [CSS Grid](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid)

### Day 2: June 18th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Grids FreeCodeCamp section. Created a template that passes all the tests for the Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** Grids are really useful. I think I'll need quite a bit of practice to use them suitably. Created a blank tribute page to ensure that the layout is correct, will likely fill this in tonight!

### Day 3: June 19th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 CodeWars Kata today using python.

**Thoughts:** Quite tired so took a while to get into each kata. Enjoyed the Pig Latin one. I completed the kata with a loop but then converted to a generator when refactoring. Need to use this more!

### Day 4: June 20th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed a CodeWars Kata today using python.

**Thoughts:** Late night session, got a solution but it didn't let me view the solutions! Tried refactoring using a recursive function instead of a few for loops - kept returning None! After a bit of digging realised I didn't return the function! Need to finish these earlier in the day, takes longer to process in the evening!

### Day 5: June 21st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued the responsive web design tribute page. Set up CSS grid structure, decided on a topic and commited to github!

**Thoughts:** Commit up in github, remember to set up as a page afterwards so github hosts the webpage, really easy and useful to setup! Grid structure in place, need to style and add content.

### Day 6: June 22nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added media queries to change grid with different size screens, tidied html structure, changed colours.

**Thoughts:** Took a while to get a layout I was happy with, still could be improved but happy with layout. Need to add content!

### Day 7: June 23rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added content to tribute page, update how it works on mobile, minor styling updates

**Thoughts:** Took a while to add content. Spend less time on next challenges. Need to get feedback on styling and how to improve!

### Day 8: June 24th, 2019

### Day 10: July 3rd, 2019

### Day 11: July 4th, 2019
