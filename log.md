# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Motivation

I've been wanting to sign up to 100 days of code for a while. I've recently been trying to create a few web apps and started the FreeCodeCamp course so I can improve my skills in design and layout (rather than using bootstrap...). Decided to finally commit to the 100 days and start recording my progress here!

### Day 1: June 17th, 2019

**Goals for first 30 days**
1. Create personal webpage
2. CodeWars 3 times per week to improve python

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Completed CSS Flexbox and working through CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to getting started on some examples, finding the CSS tutorials quite repetitive. Have learnt a lot of CSS during the challenges though, will be useful when applying to the projects!

2. [CSS Grid](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid)

### Day 2: June 18th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Grids FreeCodeCamp section. Created a template that passes all the tests for the Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** Grids are really useful. I think I'll need quite a bit of practice to use them suitably. Created a blank tribute page to ensure that the layout is correct, will likely fill this in tonight!
